    <p>Originally, the IT acronym stands for Information Technologies, that we can link to computer science, programming and such.
    In this club though, we do not only with this, but with all that stands as "geek" culture, such as video games, animes, and new technologies. <br>The objective here is to create a haven for those who share the passion for those different subjects, as well as putting them into the limelight. </p>
    <br><br></p>
    <a href="CS.html"><h2>Computer Science</h2></a>
    <p>The Computer Science moniker scares many, because it seems "geeky" <br>
    However it can be really fun</p>

    <p>We will provide information about general technologies such as Unity or Linux, as<br>
    well as interesting programming languages and tutorials.</p>
    <a href="Mangas.html"><h2>The Otaku Life</h2></a>
    <p>Because who doesn't like cute waifus?</p>
    <div>
      <img src="img/shizu.jpg" alt="slime">
    </div>
    <p>The world of otakus is quite vast, ranging from love stories such as Nisekoi, <br>
    to pure fighting like in <i>Record of Ragnarok</i>. <br>
    We believe that everyone can find its pleasure, and will make sure to share interesting <br>
    stuff with members.</p>
    <a href="Play.html"><h2>Gamers...</h2></a>
    <p>Probably why most of you are here</p>

    <p>At the end of each session, the club will put on a little playing time to let members <br>
    try to confront each other in friendly PvP games. There shall be less mainstream games, <br>
    So that people may discover new interesting games, such as <a href="https://madgarden.itch.io/eggnogg">Eggnogg</a>, that we quite like. </p>
