      Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century,
      and the form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art.
      The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning.
      Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.

      People of all ages read manga. 
      The medium includes works in a broad range of genres: 
      action, adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective,

      and fantasy, erotica (hentai), sports and games, and suspense, among others.

      The word "manga" comes from the Japanese word 漫画 composed of the two kanji 漫 (man) 
      meaning "whimsical or impromptu" and 画 (ga) meaning "pictures".
      The same term is the root of the Korean word for comics, "manhwa", 
      and the Chinese word "manhua". 
      The word first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication 
      of such works as Santō Kyōden's picturebook 'Shiji no yukikai' in 1798, 
      and in the early 19th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa's Manga hyakujo in 1814 
      and the celebrated Hokusai Manga books (1814–1834) containing assorted 
      drawings from the sketchbooks of the famous ukiyo-e artist Hokusai. 
      Rakuten Kitazawa (1876–1955) first used the word "manga" in the modern sense.
